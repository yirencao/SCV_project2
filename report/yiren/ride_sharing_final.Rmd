## Continue the last session in previous Rmd
To explore the impact of ride sharing app on the traditional taxi industry, we add the outside dataset [Transportation Network Providers - Trips](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips/m6dm-c72p) from Chicago Government which provides the ride sharing trips data.

However, the data starts from November 2018. Hence we are only allowed to explore the relationship between taxi trips and ride sharing trips since then. Moreover, the dataset keeps updating and the latest records have timestamps in September 2021. Hence, the following analysis will only use the fully available data from November 2018 to August 2021 for both taxi trips and ride sharing trips.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("new_transition1.gif")
```

`share_count` indicates the number of trips in Chicago from ride sharing companies Uber, Lyft, and Via [source](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/bacp/supp_info/transportation-network-providers.html), while `taxi_count` gives the number of normal taxi trips in Chicago.

Findings from the plot:
- Before April 2020, share riding companies already take much larger market shares compared to normal taxi companies. They mostly go up or down together.
- On April 2020, both business were hit hard by the pandemic. While the share riding trips count drops significantly, the taxi trips count is approaching 0.
- After April 2020, share riding business recovers gradually while taxi business recovers much slower with quite minor increase.

## Comparison on zones

### Before Log Transformation
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("new_before_log2.gif")
```
We encode 77 communities in Chicago into different colours. On the plot above, most of the zones with relatively lower trip counts are piled up, which indicates the necessity of doing logrithmic transformation on both axes.

For the plot, we scale the x and y axes to give them same visual length when the values are equal. 

Excluding the recession in April 2020, we find most bubbles clearly moving to the left over time, which indicates the growth of ride sharing industry. 

At the same time, although the changes of taxi trips is minor, the number of both types of trips in each zone always goes up or down together. We did research and find relevant articles to explain it.

It is known that Uber had astonishing rise in 2015 and gradually overtook the traditional taxis [source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewbender/2015/04/10/ubers-astounding-rise-overtaking-taxis-in-key-markets/?sh=695c65a43d84). We have available data starting from 2019, when the ride sharing companies have been ahead of the traditional cab companies and trip counts for this two types of transportation have entered a more stable phase. Hence, instead of have fierce competition, they go up and down together where the fluctuation is likely to be caused by other factors.

### After Log Transformation

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("new_after_log1.gif")
```

After performing logarithmic transformation, it becomes more clear that zones have same trend of increase and decline.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load("yiren_df_compare_zones2.RData")
ggpairs(df_compare_zones2[, c("taxi_count", "share_riding_count", "density")])
```

By conducting correlation test in ggpairs, we get the correlation coefficient to be 0.858, which suggests a strong positive correlation.
