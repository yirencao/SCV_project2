```{r cars, cache = FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://yirencao.shinyapps.io/testing/",
  height = "600px")

knitr::include_app("https://yihui.shinyapps.io/miniUI/",
  height = "600px")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
